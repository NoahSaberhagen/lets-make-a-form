Clone the repository, enter it, and run npm install to install dependencies.

Run a local development server with `npm run dev`

See style.css for instructions, your goal is to replicate the design found in the example folder to the best of your abilities WITHOUT editing ANY HTML.
Good luck, have fun, and let me know if you need any help :)
